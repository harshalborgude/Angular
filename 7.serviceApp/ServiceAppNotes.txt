Services : 
    - Service is a class which contains re-usable bussiness logic.
    - Multiple component classes can access service class , which contains business logic.
    - We will decorate service class with @Injectable annotation so that other classes can access
        service class using @Inject annotation.
    
    ex :
        @Injectable
        public class UserService{
            //business logic
        }
        // This component will make use of service
        public class ComponentOne{ 
            @Inject UserService;
             //business logic
        }
        // This component will make use of service
        public class ComponentTwo{
            @Inject UserService;
             //business logic
        }
