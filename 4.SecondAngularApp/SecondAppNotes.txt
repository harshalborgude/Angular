* Data Binding :
    - Data binding is a technique which is used to establish relation between "component" and "template".
        - Component is a typescript class.
        - template is a html file
    - By using data binding technique , we can send data from component class to template file and vice versa.
                            DataBinding
        Component class <---------------> Template
    - If "component" is changed then "template" will change automatically , if "template" is changed then the "component" will be changed automatically.
    - Data Bindings are four types :
        1) Interpolation 
        2) Property Binding
        3) Event Binding
        4) Two way Binding
        -----------------------
        1) Interpolation : 
            - Used to display variable/property/field value in template.
            - If variable/property value change then it will be immediately updated in template.
