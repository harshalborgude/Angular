* Data Binding :
    - Data binding is a technique which is used to establish relation between "component" and "template".
        - Component is a typescript class.
        - template is a html file
    - By using data binding technique , we can send data from component class to template file and vice versa.
                            DataBinding
        Component class <---------------> Template
    - If "component" is changed then "template" will change automatically , if "template" is changed then the "component" will be changed automatically.
    - Data Bindings are four types :
        1) Interpolation 
        2) Property Binding
        3) Event Binding
        4) Two way Binding
        -----------------------
        1) Interpolation : 
            - Used to display variable/property/field value in template.
            - If variable/property value change then it will be immediately updated in template.

            Syntax : {{ proprty Name }}

        2) Property Binding : 
            - Property Binding is used to send the data from component to template and assign the same into an attribute of tag.
            - If property is changed then immediately it will be updated in template.

            Syntax : [attribute] = *property

        3) Event Binding :
            - It is used to pass event notification from template to component.

            Syntax : <tag (event) = "method()"> / <tag onClick = "method()">
        
        4) Two-way Data Binding :
            - Two-way data binding is the combination of both "property binding" and "event binding".
            - To achieve Two-way data binding we ahve "ngModel" directive.
            - Two-way data binding is applicable only for <input/> and <select/> tags.
            - To use two-way data binding we must import "Forms Module"

            ex : [(ngModel)]="username"
                - here username value can be read by property , and property value can be shown in inpux box of template.
                - so it becomes two way binding.
        
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------
        To Achieve two-ways data binding , 
        -   Import "Forms Module" in app.module.ts file.
        -   Declare properties and methods in app.component.ts file.
        -   Write presentation logic in app.component.html file.
